## This project describe how to debug blender with pycharm. 
The method is derived from [here](https://b3d.interplanety.org/en/using-external-ide-pycharm-for-writing-blender-scripts/).
The source code is derived from [here](https://github.com/sybrenstuvel/random-blender-addons/blob/master/remote_debugger.py).
But do not support Blender 2.80b.

## set up
In the last step, you should set the path mappings to blender addon path.
Or config the pycharm project to addon path. On my windows10 system, it's 
C:\Users\zhuc\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.80\scripts\addons.
